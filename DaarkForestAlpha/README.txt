
Daark Forest:
Proof of concept demo.

What is this?:
This is a demo for Daark Forest; a dark fable, roguelite, interactive fiction game.
Dark fable, because it is inspired by all the dark fairy tales, fables and legends that parents tell their children to scare them into being good.
Roguelite, because you keep going until you die just to see how far you can go, and each playthrough is slightly different.
Interactive fiction, because there is a story being told here, and it's up to the play to uncover it.

Because this is only a demo, you can't actually win, and you only get access to the first area.
Since the enemies in the first area are weak, that means it's also pretty hard to die.

How to setup:
1. Make sure you have the latest version of python installed.
2. Navigate to the file location of main.py in your terminal.
3. Enter "python main.py" and the game will start. You may also use "py main.py" depending on your python installation.

How to play:
After setting up your character the game will present you with many choices. 
For each choice you will be presented with a set of options with corresponding numbers.
You must select what you want to do by typing only the number of your choice and pressing enter.
If you come to a point where there are no choices just press enter to continue.
At most points in the game you can enter "end game" to end the game.
That's pretty much all you need to know.
Just remember; when talking to strangers be kind, but not overly trusting.

Who made this & why?:
Hello, I'm Eli Roman.
I made this proof of concept as a final project for my intro to python class.
This was actually plan D, because my previous ideas all had unsolvable flaws.
I ended up having to make something in less than a week, so I went with what I know best.
This is the result.
